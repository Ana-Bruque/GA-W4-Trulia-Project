## Timeframe

5 hours on week 3 of part-time course at GA.

## Goals
* Identify where use of flexbox is needed.
* Create flex containers.
* Justify and align the elements inside.
* Style reusable components eg. buttons, location items with background images.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
 1. Flexbox
 2. Responsive design

## Approach 
I approached this assignment by first writing a Wireframe complemented by a tree diagram sketch, this allowed me to break the layout into horizontal rows and vertical columns and identify where classes will be needed for styling. 

Next moved on to the HTML, use of semantic tags to mark up the page and adding classes to label each element that I will need to style.

Third move was CSS, I started setting uo the broader, general styles eg. colors, fonts. Next moved on to bigger layout and use of flexbox.
The last step on this lab work was to add responsive design changing layout from 3 to 2 and 1 column as per window width.

## To do
* Improve styling for label (new/for sale) in upper-conner of listing by using CSS position Property.
